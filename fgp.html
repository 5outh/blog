# .center[The Central Issue: How to represent programs?]
- We want:
  - a natural expression for solutions
  - support for a sufficient number of genetic operators
  - to avoid expresions with unbound variables (i.e. `f(x) = x + y)`)

# .center[Some ML Code]
- The following sums a list of numbers:

```
fun sum list = 
  case list of
    nil => 0
  | h :: t => h + sum t
```

# .center[Combinator Expressions]

- Offer a way to encode modifying *functions* in a programming language
- Can directly translate combinator expressions into functional programming languages such as ML (a dialect of which, Mini-ML, is used in the paper)
- Completely avoid nonlocal variables

# .center[Hindley-Milner Type System]

- Allows *type parameters*, like function arguments, but for types.
  - e.g. `\(\forall \alpha . List(\alpha\))`

- Has a unification based type-inference mechanism
  - Allows us to figure out what types a function might produce

# .center[Genetic Operators]

`\(generate(\tau, L\))` Enables us to randomly create well-typed expressions of type `\(\tau\)`, from some library  `\(L\)` of *phrases* (either built-in values or pre-built expressions)

### Pseudocode:

1. Find a value in `\( L \)` with type `\(\tau\)`. If we can't find one, find a function in `\( L \)` which can return something of type \tau.
2. Recursively call `\( generate(\tau, L) \)` to find values for any additional arguments we might need. If no arguments can be found, repeat step 1 with a different starting function which may result in an expression with type `\( \tau \)`.

# .center[Generalized Genetic Operator]

### We need:
1. Mutation
2. Crossover
3. Random Generation

Surprisingly, we can use `\(generate(\tau, L\))`  as a basis for all 3!

### To mutate or combine expressions:

1. Make a new phrase for every subexpression in each parent
2. Construct a list of phrases containing each of these, plus the phrases for built-in values
3. Use this list of phrases as a new library `\( L \)` for `\(generate\)` to construct a new expression. 

For mutation, use a single "parent" - the individual to mutate.
For recombination, use however many parents you're crossing over.

# .center[Experimental Setup]

- Tournament Selection
- Steady-State Replacement
- Attempt not to add the same expression to the population more than once

### The Algorithm
1. Generate and evaluate the fitness of `population-size` unique expressions. If any of these expressions is a correct solution, stop immediately.
2. Choose the best amongst `tournament-size` randomly selected expressions in the population as a parent. Choose a second parent in the same way.
3. Apply the genetic operator to these parents to produce a new expression. Evaluate the fitness of new expression. If it is a correct solution, stop immediately.
4. If the new expression has a better fitness than the most unfit expression in the population, randomly choose one of the expressions in the population tied for most unfit, and replace it with the new expression.
5. If the algorithm has iterated less than `num-iterations` times, go back to step 2. Otherwise, stop.

# .center[Measuring Success]

### Effort
- Relies on two things:
  - The number of evaluations per run of the GA
  - The number of successful runs per set of runs

Uses these things to calculate the minimum number of fitness evaluations necessary to achieve a 99% chance of success in a GA. This is called **effort**.

The authors compare their solutions to those of William Langdon from papers in 1995, along with a "brute force" search.

# .center[Linear Regression]

#### Goal
Minimize error in the function `f(x) = 6x * x`

#### Combinator Expression
```
B (times (C (C (C times)) (inc (inc 1)) (inc 1)))
```
#### SML Expression
```
fn x => times (times 2 3) (inc x)
```
#### Equivalent to
```
f(x) = (2 * 3) * (x + 1)
==
f(x) = 6x + x
```

# .center[Results and Parameters (Linear Regression)]

If the genetic algorithm stops at 2141 evaluations, 60 out of 60 trials find a correct solution. The minimum effort is 2141 evaluations for a 99% probability of success. Brute force takes more than 10 minutes to find a solution, and is deemed infeasible.

# .center[Even Parity]

#### Goal
Return `true` iff a list contains an even number of `true`s

#### Combinator Expression
```
foldl (C' I (C (S (C' (C S') (C' I nand) and) or))) true
```
#### SML Expression
```
foldl (fn x => fn y => and (nand y x) (or x y)) true
```
```
foldl xor true
```

... which starts as `true`, then flips each time it encounters a `true`.

# .center[Stack Data Structure]
#### Goal
Implement `push`, `pop`, `emptyStack`, `isEmpty` and `top` for a stack

#### Combinator Expression
```
product5 (C cons) tail nil isempty head
```
#### SML Expression
```
fn x => fn y => cons y x, tail, nil, isempty, head
```

...unexciting, since it relies on finding fnctions that are already defined in the library.

# .center[Queue Data Structure]

#### Goal
Implement `enQ`, `emptyQ`, `QIsEmpty`, `deQ` and `front` for a queue

#### Combinator Expression
```
product5 (B (B (foldl cons nil)) 
            (C (Câ€™ (C cons) (foldl cons nil)))) 
            nil isempty tail head
```
#### SML Expression
```
 (fn x => fn y => 
    foldl cons nil (cons y (foldl cons nil x)), 
    nil, isempty, tail, head)
```

Note: `enQ` can be written as `reverse (cons y (reverse x))`
