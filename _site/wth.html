# .center[What is Haskell?]
- Strongly typed
  - All expressions have explicit types
- Purely functional
  - No implicit side-effects
- Lazily evaluated
  - Don't do anything until it's necessary
- Built around ideas from Category Theory 
  - But you don't need to know it!

# .center[So, what's the talk about?]

### Two major differences between traditional imperative programming languages and Haskell:

1. Control constructs: Loops and line-by-line execution versus folds, maps, filters, etc.
2. Structural abstractions: No objects, so most OOP concepts go out the window.

We're going to talk about (2), but I strongly encourage you to check out (1) as well!

# .center[We'll start with two data types:]

### A simple container...
```haskell
data Identity a = Identity a
```

### ... and a similar one that allows null values
```haskell
data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
```

# .center[Getting our feet wet: Functors]

### Idea: Transform the "inner parts" of a structure

```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```
![](images/fmap_def.png)
---
class: bg
# .center[Identity and Maybe are Functors]

### The Identity Functor directly transforms its inner type:
```haskell
instance Functor Identity where
  fmap f (Identity a) = Identity (f a)
```
### The Maybe Functor allows safe application of potentially failing computations:
```haskell
instance Functor Maybe where
  fmap f Nothing = Nothing
  fmap f (Just a) = Just (f a)
```
---
class: bg
# .center[A slight extension: Applicative]
### Idea: Box a function *as the inner type*

```haskell
class Applicative f where
  pure :: a -> f a
  (<*>) :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b -- infix operator, pronounced "apply"
```
![](images/applicative_just.png)
---
class: bg
# .center[Identity and Maybe are Applicatives]

### The Identity Applicative applies a wrapped function to a wrapped value:
```haskell
instance Applicative Identity where
  pure a = Identity a
  Identity f <*> Identity a = Identity (f a)
```

### The Maybe Applicative either applies nothing or a wrapped function to 'Maybe' a value.
```haskell
instance Applicative Maybe where
  pure a = Just a
  Nothing <*> _ = Nothing
  _ <*> Nothing = Nothing
  Just f <*> Just b = Just (f b)
```
---
class: bg
# .center[...And Monads]
### Idea: Build complete structures out of inner types and graft them together. This allows us to "chain" computations.

```haskell
class Monad m where
  return :: a -> m a -- same as `pure` from Applicative
  (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b -- pronounced "bind"
```
![](images/bind_def.png)
---
class: bg
# .center[Identity and Maybe are Monads]

### The Identity Monad allows only basic function chaining.
```haskell
instance Monad Identity where
  return a = Identity a
  Identity a >>= f = f a
```

### The Maybe Monad allows safe chaining of computations that might fail.
```haskell
instance Monad Maybe where
  return a = Just a
  Nothing >>= f = Nothing
  Just a >>= f = f a
```

# .center[Why should I care?]

1. The process of instantiating Functors, Applicatives and Monads (and other types, there are several!) is a highly general process. Many simple types generate incredibly powerful Functors, Applicatives, and Monads.
2. Haskell's 'do' notation provides an alternate syntax for the chaining of monadic functions, giving you a lot of power at your fingertips while maintaining clean, clear code.

```haskell
do x <- funcA            funcA >>= \x -> 
   funcB          ===      funcB >>= \_ ->
   return x                  return x
```
