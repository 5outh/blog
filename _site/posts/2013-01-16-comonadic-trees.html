	<p>We’ve seen in the previous post what monads are and how they work. We saw a few monad instances of some common Haskell structures and toyed around with them a little bit. Towards the end of the post, I asked about making a Monad instance for a generalized tree data type. My guess is that it was relatively difficult. But why? Well, one thing that I didn’t touch on in my last post was that the monadic <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> operation can also be represented as <code>(join . fmap f)</code>, that is, <code>a &gt;&gt;= f = join $ fmap f a</code>, as long as <code>a</code> has a <code>Functor</code> instance. <code>join</code> is a generalized function of the following type:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">join ::</span> (<span class="dt">Monad</span> m) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> m (m a) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m a</code></pre>
<p>Basically, this function takes a nested monad and “joins” it with the top level in order to get a regular <code>m a</code> out of it. Since you bind to functions that take as and produce <code>m a</code>s, <code>fmap f</code> actually makes <code>m (m a)</code>s and <code>join</code> is just the tool to fix up the <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> function to produce what we want. Keep in mind that <code>join</code> is not a part of the <code>Monad</code> typeclass, and therefore the above definition for <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> will not work. However, if we are able to make a specific <code>join</code> function (named something else, since <code>join</code> is taken!) for whatever type we are making a <code>Monad</code> instance for, we can certainly use the above definition. I don’t want to spend too much time on this, but I would like to direct the reader to the <code>Monad</code> instance for <code>[]</code> that I mentioned in the last post – can you see any similarities between this and the way I structured <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> above? Now back to the <code>Tree</code> type. Can you devise some way to join <code>Tree</code>s? That is, can you think of a way to flatten a <code>Tree</code> of <code>Tree a</code>s into a <code>Tree a</code>? This actually turns out to be quite difficult, and up to interpretation as to how you want to do it. It’s not as straightforward as moving <code>Maybe (Maybe a)</code>s into <code>Maybe a</code>s or <code>[[a]]</code>s into <code>[a]</code>s. Maybe if we put a <code>Monoid</code> restriction on our <code>a</code> type, as such…</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Tree</span> a <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Node</span> a [<span class="dt">Tree</span> a] <span class="fu">|</span> <span class="dt">Leaf</span> a <span class="kw">deriving</span> (<span class="dt">Show</span>, <span class="dt">Eq</span>)

<span class="kw">instance</span> (<span class="dt">Monoid</span> a) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Monad</span> (<span class="dt">Tree</span> a) <span class="kw">where</span> <span class="fu">...</span></code></pre>
<p>…we could use <code>mappend</code> in some way in order to concatenate all of the nested elements using some joining function. While this is a valid way to define a <code>Tree Monad</code>, it seems a little bit “unnatural.” I won’t delve too deeply into that, though, because that’s not the point of this post. Let’s instead take a look at a structure related to monads that may make more sense for our generalized <code>Tree</code> type.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-a-comonad">What is a comonad?</h4>
<p>Recall the type signature of <code>&gt;&gt;=</code> for Monads:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">(&gt;&gt;=) ::</span> (<span class="dt">Monad</span> m) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> (m a) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m b) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m b</code></pre>
<p>That is, we’re taking an m a and converting it to an m b by means of some function that operates on the contained type. In other words, we’re producing a new value using elements contained inside the Monad. Comonads have a similar function:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">(=&gt;&gt;) ::</span> (<span class="dt">Comonad</span> w) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> w a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (w a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> w b</code></pre>
<p>The difference here is that the function that we use to produce a new value operates on the whole – we’re not operating on the elements contained inside the Comonad, but the Comonad itself, to produce a new value. We also have a function similar to the Monadic <code>return</code>:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">coreturn ::</span> (<span class="dt">Comonad</span> w) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> w a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a</code></pre>
<p>Whereas <code>return</code> puts a value into a Monadic context, <code>coreturn</code> extracts a value from a Comonadic context. I mentioned the Monadic <code>join</code> function above because I would also like to mention that there is a similar operation for Comonads:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">cojoin ::</span> (<span class="dt">Comonad</span> w) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> w a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> w (w a)</code></pre>
<p>Instead of “removing a layer,” we’re “adding” a layer. And, as it turns out, just as <code>a &gt;&gt;= f</code> can be represented as <code>join $ fmap f a</code>, <code>=&gt;&gt;</code> can be representaed as : <code>a =&gt;&gt; f = fmap f $ cojoin a</code>.</p>
<p>The full Comonad typeclass (as I like to define it) is as follows:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">class</span> (<span class="dt">Functor</span> w) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Comonad</span> w <span class="kw">where</span>
<span class="ot">	coreturn ::</span> (<span class="dt">Comonad</span> w) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> w a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a
<span class="ot">	cojoin   ::</span> (<span class="dt">Comonad</span> w) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> w a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> w (w a)
	a <span class="ot">=&gt;</span><span class="fu">&gt;</span> f <span class="fu">=</span> fmap f <span class="fu">$</span> cojoin a </code></pre>
<p>By now, it should at least be clear that Monads and Comonads are related – it shouldn’t be hard to see why they are so similar in name! <em>Note: There is a package called <code>Control.Comonad</code> on Hackage. It uses different names for the Comonad operations, but they do the same things. It’s a good package, but I wanted to show how Comonads are built and use the operation names I used to make things clearer.</em> **</p>
<h4 id="what-can-i-do-with-comonads">What can I do with Comonads?</h4>
<p>As it turns out, the <code>Tree a</code> structure that I’ve been mentioning fits into the Comonadic context quite well, and provides a simple example as to how Comonads work.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the implementation of the Comonad typeclass mentioned above:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">class</span> (<span class="dt">Functor</span> w) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Comonad</span> w <span class="kw">where</span>
<span class="ot">  coreturn ::</span> w a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a
<span class="ot">  cojoin   ::</span> w a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> w (w a)
<span class="ot">  (=&gt;&gt;)    ::</span>  w a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (w a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> w b</code></pre>
<p>Then we’ll go ahead and make a <code>Functor</code> instance of our <code>Tree a</code> data type:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Tree</span> a <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Node</span> a [<span class="dt">Tree</span> a] <span class="fu">|</span> <span class="dt">Leaf</span> a <span class="kw">deriving</span> (<span class="dt">Show</span>, <span class="dt">Eq</span>)

<span class="kw">instance</span> <span class="dt">Functor</span> <span class="dt">Tree</span> <span class="kw">where</span>
  fmap f (<span class="dt">Leaf</span> a) <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="fu">$</span> f a
  fmap f (<span class="dt">Node</span> a b) <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Node</span> (f a) (map (fmap f) b)</code></pre>
<p>From here, we’re able to make a Comonadic <code>Tree</code> like so:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">instance</span> <span class="dt">Comonad</span> <span class="dt">Tree</span> <span class="kw">where</span>
  coreturn (<span class="dt">Leaf</span> a) <span class="fu">=</span> a
  coreturn (<span class="dt">Node</span> a _) <span class="fu">=</span> a
  cojoin l<span class="fu">@</span>(<span class="dt">Leaf</span> a)   <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Leaf</span> l
  cojoin n<span class="fu">@</span>(<span class="dt">Node</span> a b) <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Node</span> n (map cojoin b)
  x <span class="ot">=&gt;</span><span class="fu">&gt;</span> f <span class="fu">=</span> fmap f <span class="fu">$</span> cojoin x</code></pre>
<p>The only real point of confusion here is in the <code>cojoin</code> function for <code>Node</code>s. But, all we are doing is wrapping the entire node in a new node, and then mapping cojoin over every child node of the current node to produce its children. In other words, we’re turning a <code>Node a</code> into a <code>Node (Node a)</code>, which is exactly what we want to do. So what can we do with a comonadic tree? Let’s tackle a simple problem. Say we’re hanging out in California, and we want to get to the East coast as quickly as possible. We don’t really care where on the East coast we end up – we just want to get there. We can map out the different paths that we can take, along with the time it takes to get to each one. In other words, we’re going to model spots on the map as <code>Node</code>s on a <code>Tree</code> and give them a weight corresponding to the time it takes to get there. We can model this situation with a <code>Tree</code> as follows:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">trip <span class="fu">=</span> 
 <span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">0</span> 
   [<span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">6</span> 
     [<span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">2</span> 
       [<span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">6</span> 
         [<span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">1</span>], 
        <span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">14</span>], 
        <span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">1</span> 
          [<span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">19</span>], 
        <span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">8</span> 
          [<span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">21</span>, 
           <span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">4</span> 
           [<span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">6</span>]
          ]
      ],
    <span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">3</span> 
      [<span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">9</span> 
        [<span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">12</span>], 
       <span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">14</span> 
        [<span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">6</span>, 
         <span class="dt">Node</span> <span class="dv">3</span> 
           [<span class="dt">Leaf</span> <span class="dv">1</span>]
        ]
      ]
   ]</code></pre>
<p>The number of each <code>Node</code> marks its distance from the previous <code>Node</code>. The root Node of the <code>Tree</code> is the starting point, so it is 0 distance away from itself. What we want to do to find the shortest path through the country is essentially, as follows. First, we’re going to need to check the deepest nodes, and find their minimum distance children. We will add the distance of the <code>Node</code> closest to the one we’re examining to its own distance, to find the shortest way to get from the node we’re examining to the destination. Once all of that has been done, we’ll need to traverse up the tree, repeating this as we go. By the end of the algorithm, the root <code>Node</code> will be marked with the shortest distance to the destination. Now, that may sound somewhat iterative in nature, but we’re going to morph this into a comonadic operation. First, let’s take a look at a function we can use to find the minimum distance to the next level of our tree:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">shortest ::</span> (<span class="dt">Num</span> a, <span class="dt">Ord</span> a) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Tree</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a
shortest (<span class="dt">Leaf</span> x) <span class="fu">=</span> x
shortest (<span class="dt">Node</span> x xs) <span class="fu">=</span> x <span class="fu">+</span> (minimum <span class="fu">$</span> map shortest xs)</code></pre>
<p>This is relatively simple, and does precisely what was mentioned above: adds the minimum value contained in the connected <code>Node</code>s to the parent <code>Node</code>. Next, take a look at the type signature. We can see that this function produces a new number from a tree full of numbers. This coincides precisely with the function type we need to use with <code>=&gt;&gt;</code> so we’ll be able to use it to get exactly what we want. The rest is very simple:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">minimumDist <span class="fu">=</span> trip <span class="ot">=&gt;</span><span class="fu">&gt;</span> shortest</code></pre>
<p>This produces a tree full of the minimum distances from each node to the East coast. Pulling the actual value out is as easy as calling <code>coreturn</code> on the resultant tree.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
